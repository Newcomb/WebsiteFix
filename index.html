    <h1>Design</h1>
    <p>When you use our CSS to style the webpage you will be enveloped with
    a medieval theme. It should feel like you are sitting in an ancient library, reading off
  of parchment paper, leather, and wood. We picked two fonts to help support our Theme,
one being a medieval styled one and the other being more flowy to represent the emphasis on
caligraphy during that time period. The setup is simplistic to represent how things would
have been hundreds of years ago.</p>
  <h1>New Features</h1>
  <p>In addition to the theme, we changed the navigation center so it is vertically
  aligned and increased the font size for accessibility. We also made it fixed for easy
access while scrolling through the site. Along with the changes to the navigaiton, we
also realigned the partner information so that it is vertical. The class material is now
much easier to read and access due to margins and/or padding on most of the elements. In the
prep and lab links the prompt, instructions, and scoring sections are all seperated by
different backgrounds. Classmates are placed onto a leather strip and seating is on
a horizontal scroll similar to a map. The account page features a vertical parchment
scroll that the user writes their information on. </p>

    <h1>Theme</h1>
    <p>When you use our CSS to style the webpage you will be enveloped with
    a medieval theme. It should feel like you are sitting in an old library, reading off
  of parchment paper, leather, and wood. We picked two fonts to help support our Theme,
one being a medieval styled one and the other being more flowy to represent the emphasis on
caligraphy during that time period.</p>
  <h1>New Features</h1>
  <p>In addition to the theme, we changed the navigation center so it is vertically
  aligned and increased the font size for accessibility. We also made it fixed for easy
access while scrolling through the site. Along with the changes to the navigaiton, we
also realigned the partner information so that it is also vertical. The material is now
much easier to read and access due to margins and/or padding on most of the elements. </p>
